# Eight-Puzzle-Game-Code
8-puzzle consists of an area divided into a 3*3 grid. Each cell of the grid represents a tile
numbered from 1 to 8 (in any order) with one tile being empty. A tile that is next to the
empty cell can be moved into the empty space, leaving its previous position empty in
turn. The aim of the puzzle is to achieve a given configuration of tiles from a given
(different) configuration by sliding the individual tiles around the grid.
